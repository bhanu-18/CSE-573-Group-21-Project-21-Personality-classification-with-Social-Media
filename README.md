Download three files (users.csv, users-likes.csv, likes.csv) from the given dataset link above and place the three files in the repo's Data folder.

Download and install R in your system

In your terminal, go to the Code folder and run the following code files:

a. Run command - "Rscript SVD_Cluster_Analysis.R" for SVD dimensionality reduction and visualizing K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms for SVD clusters.

b. Run command - "Rscript LDA_Cluster_Analysis.R" for LDA dimensionality reduction and visualizing K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms for LDA clusters.

c. Run command - "Rscript Prediction_Analysis.R" for performing Linear and Logistic Regression algorithms to predict user personality types.

Evaluations folder contains the resulting R visualization files from running each of the above files in the code folder.
